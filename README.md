# Nerde
A small algebra calculator that can do calculus as well

#### How to run

`pip install sympy`

- `python main.py`

#### Commmands:

- `solve eqn/solve/solve equation` -  solves an algebra equation (for algebraic expressions, 2x = 2*x )
- `clearscreen/cls/clear` - clears the screen
- `plot func/plot function/plot` - plot a function in terms of x
- `factorise polynomial/factorise poly` - factorise a polynomial in any way possible (complex expressions like x<sup>2</sup> + 4 are evaluated in terms of `i`)
- `quit/exit` - quit the program
- `diff/differentiate/derivative` - get the derivative of a function (in terms of x only so far)
- `lim/limit/calculate limit` - get the <i>lim</i> of a function as x -> some value
- `integ/integrate/integral` - get the &int; of a function in terms of x (use oo and -oo to represent infinity, negative infinity)
